# Why PikaCSS?

PikaCSS is designed with a focus on developer experience, performance, and flexibility. Here's why we believe it's a great choice for modern web development:

## Developer Experience

### Intuitive API Design

PikaCSS provides a simple and intuitive API that makes styling your components feel natural:

```ts
pika({
	'color': 'red',
	'fontSize': '16px',
	'$:hover': {
		color: 'blue'
	}
})
```

This object-based syntax is familiar to developers who work with modern JavaScript/TypeScript, making it easy to learn and use.

### TypeScript Support

Built with TypeScript from the ground up, PikaCSS offers:

- Full type safety for all CSS properties
- Intelligent autocomplete suggestions
- Runtime type checking
- Custom property type definitions

This ensures you catch potential errors early in development and get better IDE support.

### Real-time Preview

The preview feature allows you to see the generated CSS in real-time as you write your styles:

```ts
styop({
	color: 'red',
	fontSize: '16px'
})
```

This immediate feedback helps you understand how your styles will be applied and makes debugging easier.

## Performance

### Atomic CSS Generation

PikaCSS generates atomic CSS classes, which means:

- Smaller CSS bundle size
- Better caching
- Reduced CSS specificity conflicts
- Improved rendering performance

### Smart Optimization

The engine automatically:

- Deduplicates identical styles
- Removes unused styles
- Optimizes selectors
- Combines similar rules

This results in optimized CSS output without manual intervention.

## Flexibility

### Plugin System

PikaCSS features a powerful plugin system that allows you to:

- Extend core functionality
- Add custom features
- Modify style processing
- Integrate with other tools

### Multiple Output Formats

Choose how you want to use PikaCSS in your code:

```ts
// String format
pika.str({ color: 'red' }) // 'a b c'

// Array format
pika.arr({ color: 'red' }) // ['a', 'b', 'c']

// Inline format
pika.inl({ color: 'red' }) // directly applies styles
```

### Framework Integration

PikaCSS works seamlessly with popular frameworks:

- Vue
- React
- Nuxt
- Vite

Each integration is optimized for the specific framework's needs and conventions.

## Modern Features

### CSS Variables Support

Built-in support for CSS variables with autocomplete:

```ts
const config = {
	variables: [
		['primary-color', '#ff0000']
	]
}
```

### Keyframe Animations

Type-safe keyframe definitions with autocomplete:

```ts
const config = {
	keyframes: [
		['fade-in', {
			from: { opacity: 0 },
			to: { opacity: 1 }
		}]
	]
}
```

### Shortcuts

Create reusable style combinations:

```ts
const config = {
	shortcuts: [
		['btn', {
			padding: '1rem 0.5rem',
			borderRadius: '0.25rem',
			backgroundColor: '#3b82f6',
			color: '#ffffff'
		}]
	]
}
```
